### Running the Website

### 1.1. The Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `yarn install` to install all of the dependencies necessary to run the ReactJS app. Then run `yarn start` to start the ReactJS app.

Please note that some properties that the backend takes in are defined as blank objects. These are objects that can be defined by you, as the backend will simply store your object on some routes and then return it to you on other routes (i.e. the backend doesn't need to understand the schema of some objects you pass it). An example of this object is all of the data associated with a quiz.


### 1.2. The Backend

The backend server exists in an individual repository. After you clone this repo, you must run `yarn install` in `backend` directory once.

To run the backend server, simply run `yarn start` in the `backend` directory. This will start the backend.

To view the API interface for the backend you can navigate to the base URL of the backend (e.g. `http://localhost:5005`). This will list all of the HTTP routes that you can interact with.

The backend is persistent in terms of data storage. That means the data will remain even after your express server process stops running. If you want to reset the data in the backend to the original starting state, you can run `yarn reset` in the backend directory. If you want to make a copy of the backend data (e.g. for a backup) then simply copy `database.json`. If you want to start with an empty database, you can run `yarn clear` in the backend directory.

Once the backend has started, you can view the API documentation by navigating to `http://localhost:[port]` in a web browser.

The port that the backend runs on (and that the frontend can use) is specified in `frontend/src/config.js`. You can change the port in this file. This file exists so that your frontend knows what port to use when talking to the backend.
