UI Improvement

Having too many button may be a problem for the user to access anything in the web, so the first thing that we want to make sure that the focus is only on the quizzes only and not how there is so many thing to press on the screen. So by making the quizzes as card it makes the user to easily click it to see the detail and edit it, also there is a clear indication on the card what icon to press to do what, in this case it is delete and start the quiz.

Easy to get back to the homepage by clicking the logo since if they do not find a 'back' button then with instict they will try to click the logo first.

Picking a natural colour and not the color that clash with each other that make the user hurt their eye.

Having a familiar icon in every button so it is easir to get recognize by the user

Adding default thumbnail reduce the numver of unloaded image on the client side server

The use of general icons is preferably prefered than using lables or text

UX improvement

Since. we are not able to close session due to admin for closing the web, and in order for admin to close it correctly, we intentionally let the diaklog to be opened if admin left abruptly

We used naming order sorting system on disiplaying quizzes, such that it gives a nice consistency to admin
